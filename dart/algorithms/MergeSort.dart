## Agorithm: Merge Sort ##

# split in half
m = n / 2
# recursive sorts
sort a[1..m]
sort a[m+1..n]
# merge sorted sub-arrays using temp array
b = copy of a[1..m]
i = 1, j = m+1, k = 1
while i <= m and j <= n,
    a[k++] = (a[j] < b[i]) ? a[j++] : b[i++]
    → invariant: a[1..k] in final position
while i <= m,
    a[k++] = b[i++]
    → invariant: a[1..k] in final position
